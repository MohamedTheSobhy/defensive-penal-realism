#  AI Evaluation of Punishment in Defensive Penal Realism


> A philosophical and ethical simulation of AI-guided justice in response to extreme, non-deterrable crimes.

## Project Overview

This project simulates a **defensive penal philosophy** where pain is reintroduced—not as revenge—but as a *last-resort deterrent* against sadistic and ideologically extreme offenders. It uses rule-based AI logic to:

- Classify offenders based on their psychological and criminal profiles.
- Propose pain-calibrated interventions.
- Preserve human dignity while protecting societal safety.

 Inspired by thinkers like **Michel Foucault** and **Jeremy Bentham**, the system blends legal philosophy, moral AI, and behavioral deterrence.

 **Original Work**:  
This project, including its underlying concept, structure, and code, is the **original intellectual and creative work of Mohamed The Sobhy**. Any use, adaptation, or citation should credit the author appropriately.
